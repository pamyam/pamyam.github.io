      <h2>2.‎ ‏OPEN [SOURCE/CULTURE/TECH] CITIZENSHIP</h2>
      <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.</p>
      <p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.</p>
      <p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.</p>

      <h2>3.‎ ‏EXPECTED BEHAVIOR</h2>

      <p>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</p>

      <h2>4.‎ ‏UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR</h2>
      <p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>

      <h2>5.‎ CONSEQUENCES OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR</h2>
      <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
      Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
      <p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.</p>
